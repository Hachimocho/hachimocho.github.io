Hi folks! My name is Bryce Gernon, and I'm a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Rochester Institute of Technology, focused on novel AI models and methods. I work within a variety of domains, including but not limited to, computer vision, graph theory, and reinforcement learning. There's not a lot here currently, but I'm working on it!
